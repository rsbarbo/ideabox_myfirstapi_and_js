# IdeaBox

* Ruby version: ruby 2.3.1p112
* Rails version: Rails 5.0.0.1

Single-page app with full CRUD functionality for capturing ideas. Focus was to provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface, sans styling and other client-side frameworks. First formal JavaScript project created in one-day timeframe.

Tech Stack

Client-side: JavaScript | jQuery | AJAX
Server-side: Ruby on Rails | Ruby | PostgreSQL | ActiveRecord

My Areas of Focus:
Efficient DOM traversal
Follow DRY and SRP as close as possible in relatively new language (JavaScript)
Make service calls to internal API via AJAX
