# IdeaBox (Exploring APIs, JS, and JQuery)

This project covers my first attempt to create a functional program with JS, JQuery, and serving an API with Ruby on Rails:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.3.1p112
* Rails version: Rails 5.0.0.1

The project is fully functional, and I have succeeded in my attempt. For more info, please visit:

Thank you;
